            <h2>Introduction to Medical VQA</h2>
            <p>Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) is an interdisciplinary field that combines artificial intelligence, computer vision, and healthcare to develop systems capable of answering medical-related questions based on visual data. This research aims to assist doctors, medical students, and researchers by providing instant answers to queries related to medical images, enhancing diagnostic processes and educational methods.</p>
            <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image analysis</li>
                <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding and processing medical questions</li>
                <li>TensorFlow and PyTorch for building and training AI models</li>
                <li>Medical datasets like ImageCLEF and VisualQA for training and evaluation</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Research Objectives</h3>
            <p>The goal of our medical VQA research is to create an AI system that improves accuracy and efficiency in answering questions about medical images. This includes reducing diagnostic times for radiologists and providing an educational tool for medical students to learn from real-case scenarios.</p>
            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>As a lead researcher, I spearheaded the development of the VQA model, focusing on improving the accuracy of image analysis and question understanding. I also collaborated with medical professionals to validate the model's effectiveness in clinical settings and worked on integrating the VQA system into educational platforms for medical training.</p>
            <h3>Challenges Overcome</h3>
            <p>A significant challenge was developing an AI model capable of understanding complex medical imagery and accurately answering diverse medical questions. This was overcome through advanced neural network architectures and continuous refinement of the model with real-world medical data.</p>
