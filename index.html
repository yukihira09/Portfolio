            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Pham Le Huy - a senior student at International University that is currently majoring in Computer Science. In the future, I intend to become an AI researcher with the desire to dive as deep as possible into the world full of probability and mathematics. Since I'm a little shy, I decide to put an image of my lovely crush below instead of me. Enjoy!</p>
